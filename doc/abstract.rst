**SPL** is a Python/Fortran 2003 library for B-Splines/NURBS and Computer Aided Design Algorithms.

**SPL** can be used in three different ways:

1. *Fortran 90/95* subroutines through the file **fortran/src/bsplines/bspline.F90**

2. *Fortran 2003* objects, mainly the **mapping** and **cad** objects

3. The same objects as in *2.* but through *Python*
